# Text Encryption App

## Overview

This is a simple web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the [CryptoJS](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/) library.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt any text input using a randomly generated key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt the encrypted text using the provided key.
- **Random Key Generation**: Ensures that the same text can be encrypted to different outputs by generating a new key each time.
